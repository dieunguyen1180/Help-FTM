                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Process Control –</b> Enable or disable the Process Control barcode feature.  The feature allows control of the process by comparing the barcode string of a product to the corresponding process currently running.  It ensures that the product matches the process.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Process Traceability -</b> Enable or disable the Process Traceability barcode feature.  This feature links each product’s profile data with its barcode.</p>
                    <ul class="jhgj">
                        <li><b>Note:</b> When both Process Control and Traceability are selected, radio buttons appear that let you specify using one or two scanners, together with fields for entering identifying prefixes for the scanners.  The feature enables the choice of applying traceability at the oven entrance or exit.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Scanner Prefix –</b> Enter the predefined prefix number to identify each barcode scanner when using two scanners.  The software uses this prefix to determine which scan goes to which feature—process control or traceability.  The prefix is programmed using the barcode manufactures software program.  Contact the barcode scanner manufacture for more information.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Missing Barcode Alarm –</b> This option can be enabled or disabled when the Traceability (Exit) function is selected.  The software uses the Board Sensor to track product location in the oven.  If the board sensor detects a product entering the oven, but the Barcode Reader doesn’t read its code, the system can activate a software or hardware alarm.  The Traceability (Exit) function also requires entry of the Distance from Board Sensor to Traceability Barcode Reader value.</p>
                    <p>Distance from Board Sensor to Traceability Barcode Reader - Measure and enter the distance between the board sensor and the Traceability Barcode Reader when installed at the oven exit in this field.  The software uses this measurement to track product position so it can associate the correct board when the barcode is scanned.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Barcode Process Control String –</b> If the barcode Process Control is enabled, the process control string will be displayed.  The string can be changed each time Virtual Profiling is started.  The software will list the string as: &lt;Disable&gt; until you enter a string.</p>

                    <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Process_Traceability_PT"></a>Process Traceability (PT)</h3>
                    <p>The Process Traceability function enables process traceability with profile data for every product linked to its barcode number.&#160; The software will match the barcode number and complete process data to every single production board recorded by the system.&#160; The Process Traceability Barcode function can be used with or without the Process Control function.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Process_Control_PC"></a>Process Control (PC)</h3>
                    <p>The Process Control function enables process control by reading the product barcode label before the product enters the oven and confirms that a specific area of the barcode correlates to a specified product.&#160; If the barcode string value matches the current process string value, production continues as normal.&#160; If the incoming barcode string value differs from your defined string value, an alarm is activated and the process can be stopped until the operator acknowledges the alarm and takes the proper action. In order to utilize the Process Control feature, your barcode strings need to contain at least one character (referred to as a “String”) that is common to all boards in a production run. For example, when running “Product A”, all barcode labels for “Product A” would be “ABCxxxx”, where “ABC” would represent the common characters (String) on each barcode label, and “xxxx” would represent the rest of the barcode characters, which would typically be unique to each individual board. The common character string can fall anywhere within the barcode. The Process Control Barcode function can be used with or without the Process Traceability barcode function.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Barcode_Product_Sensor"></a>Barcode Product Sensor (BPS)</h3>
                    <p>The BPS is an optional product sensor used exclusively with the barcode option for improved functionality. Using the BPS, the system can determine if any given product has had its barcode label successfully scanned.&#160; If the product passes the sensor and there are no barcode strings that have been read into the software, then the system will give a NO READ alarm.&#160;(Alarm 5C)</p>

                    <h3 class="Heading3">Installing Scanners On The Load Conveyor</h3>
                    <p>For the Process Control barcode function, it is necessary to install the barcode scanner(s) directly to the load conveyor.  The load conveyor-power input is connected to the optional Alarm Relay.  The optional Alarm Relay controls the load conveyor, thereby controlling the flow of product into the oven.  When a Process Control or any other critical alarm is activated, the power to the load conveyor is cut; stopping the flow of product into the oven.  This ensures that no products enter the oven under alarm conditions.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The installation positions of the Scanner(s) and BPS are determined by your hardware set up.  Below are some guidelines for installation of barcode scanners and BPS:</p>

                    <p><b>Note:</b> The barcode option requires a software key in order to function.  The software key must always remain connected during use.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h3><a name="Process"></a>Process Control</h3>
                    <p>There are two methods for defining the characters of a barcode string that will be used for Process Control – Wildcard (default) and Parsing. See <a href="Appendix_C.htm#Barcode_Tab" style="font-style: italic; color: #0000cd;">Appendix C – Barcode</a>  for how to change between methods.</p>
                    <p><b>Wildcard</b> - When Virtual Profiling is started, the system produces the Barcode Process Control dialog box which gives you the opportunity to: Enter the Process Control String, Change the Process Control String, or Disable Process Control for this Virtual Profile run.</p>
                    <p>If the Process Control function is enabled (Global Preferences) and the Wildcard method is selected (Configuration Program), this dialog box will appear every time Virtual Profiling is enabled. Enter the barcode control string that is specific to the product family that is running.  The software reads the incoming string and compares it to that of the specified Process Control String, for every product.  If the string values differ, an alarm is activated, and the process is stopped via the optional <i>Alarm Relay</i> device.</p>

You enable this function by selecting Traceability under Barcode tab in the Global Preferences and installing a PTS at the oven entrance on the load conveyor.&#160; </p>
