                    <p>The <i>Process Traceability</i> function enables process traceability with profile data for every product linked to its barcode number.  The software will match the barcode number and complete process data to every single production board recorded by the system.  The <i>Process Traceability</i> barcode function can be used with or without the <i>Process Control</i> function.</p>

                    <p>The <i>Process Control</i> function enables process control by reading the product barcode label before the product enters the oven and confirms that a specific area of the barcode correlates to a specified product.  If the barcode string value matches the current process string value, production continues as normal.  If the incoming barcode string value differs from your defined string value, an alarm is activated and the process can be stopped until the operator acknowledges the alarm and takes the proper action. In order to utilize the Process Control feature, your barcode strings need to contain at least one character (referred to as a “String”) that is common to all boards in a production run. For example, when running “Product A”, all barcode labels for “Product A” would be “ABCxxxx”, where “ABC” would represent the common characters (String) on each barcode label, and “xxxx” would represent the rest of the barcode characters, which would typically be unique to each individual board. The common character string can fall anywhere within the barcode. The <i>Process Control</i> barcode function can be used with or without the <i>Process Traceability</i> barcode function.</p>

                    <p>Additional control/functionality can be implemented through the use of a separate product sensor and software configuration. Only one of the following two methods below can be configured at a time. The configuration for these is set in the ConfigurationProgram.exe. See <a href="Appendix_C.htm#Barcode_Tab" style="font-style: italic;">Appendix C – Barcode</a> for more information.</p>
                    <h4 class="Heading4">Barcode Product Sensor</h4>
                    <p>The <i>Barcode Product Sensor</i> (BPS) configuration uses an optional product sensor to identify that a product is passing by the barcode scanner.  If the product passes the sensor and no barcode or an invalid barcode ID have been read into the software, then the system will post an alarm (Alarm 5C), and when applicable, stop the infeed conveyor. If a valid barcode ID was received, the product will continue moving into the oven.</p>
                    <h4 class="Heading4">Barcode Stop Sensor</h4>
                    <p>The <i>Barcode Stop Sensor</i> (BSS) configuration uses optional product sensor for ensuring each products barcode ID has been received. This configuration may be needed when short in-feed conveyors are in use, and there is not enough time to validate the barcode ID before the product reaches the oven. With this configuration, as soon as the sensor is triggered by a product, the in-feed conveyor is stopped. If a valid barcode ID has been received within the set amount of time, the product is released and allowed into the oven. If the barcode ID is missing or wrong, an alarm will be posted.</p>

                    <p>For the Process Control barcode function, it is necessary to install the barcode scanner(s) directly to the load conveyor.  The load conveyor-power input is connected to the optional Alarm Relay.  The optional Alarm Relay controls the load conveyor, thereby controlling the flow of product into the oven.  When a Process Control or any other critical alarm is activated, the power to the load conveyor is cut; stopping the flow of product into the oven.  This ensures that no products enter the oven under alarm conditions.</p>

                    <p>The installation positions of the Scanner(s) and BPS or BSS sensors are determined by your hardware set up and operational needs.  Below are some guidelines for installation of barcode scanners and BPS or BSS:</p>

                    <p><b>Note:</b> The barcode option requires a software key in order to function.  The software key must always remain connected during use.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h3><a name="Process_Control"></a>Process Control</h3>
                    <p>There are two methods for defining the characters of a barcode string that will be used for Process Control – Wildcard (default) and Parsing. See <a href="Appendix_C.htm#Barcode_Tab" style="font-style: italic; color: #0000cd;">Appendix C – Barcode</a>  for how to change between methods.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Wildcard</b> - When Virtual Profiling is started, the system produces the Barcode Process Control dialog box which gives you the opportunity to: Enter the Process Control String, Change the Process Control String, or Disable Process Control for this Virtual Profile run.</p>
                    <p>If the Process Control function is enabled (Global Preferences) and the Wildcard method is selected (Configuration Program), this dialog box will appear every time Virtual Profiling is enabled. Enter the barcode control string that is specific to the product family that is running.  The software reads the incoming string and compares it to that of the specified Process Control String, for every product.  If the string values differ, an alarm is activated, and the process is stopped via the <i>optional Alarm Relay</i> device.</p>

                    <p><b>Parsing</b> – Whereas with the Wildcard method, the Control String characters must be sequential, using the Parsing method allows you to specify characters in any position of the string to be the Control String.</p>
