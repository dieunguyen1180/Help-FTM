                    <p>This optional feature enables a customer to ensure that every instance of the software is always using the same Process Window files and prevents unauthorized editing of specifications.</p>
                    <p>Many factories may have multiple systems and the same Process Windows may need to be used at any one of those systems. This can lead to mistakes being made when transferring files from one machine to another. Or someone may make a change to a specification on one machine, and the change may not be made on others or the updated file is not copied to all other software. This can lead to varying profile results depending on which PC the data is collected in.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>This feature eliminates these situations by ‘centralizing’ the creation and editing of Process Window files through the use of a separate application, accessible only by authorized personnel. All Process Window files reside in a specified central directory, and each instance of the automatic system software gets their Process Windows from this location. Additionally, all creation and editing functions of the Process Window within the automatic system software are disabled. This ensures that no matter who is running the profile or at which location, the correct, approved Process Window specifications are the only ones available.</p>
