                    <p>This optional feature enables a customer to ensure that every instance of the software is always using the same Process Window files and prevents unauthorized editing of specifications.</p>
                    <p>Many factories may have multiple systems and the same Process Windows may need to be used at any one of those systems. This can lead to mistakes being made when transferring files from one machine to another. Or someone may make a change to a specification on one machine, and the change may not be made on others or the updated file is not copied to all other software. This can lead to varying profile results depending on which PC the data is collected in.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>This feature eliminates these situations by ‘centralizing’ the creation and editing of Process Window files through the use of a separate application, accessible only by authorized personnel. All Process Window files reside in a specified central directory, and each instance of the automatic system software gets their Process Windows from this location. Additionally, all creation and editing functions of the Process Window within the automatic system software are disabled. This ensures that no matter who is running the profile or at which location, the correct, approved Process Window specifications are the only ones available.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Note</b>: For the Centralized Process Window Control to function, the appropriately programmed USB dongle key must always remain connected to the PC during use. You can verify if you have the optional feature by viewing the Software Key panel in the Hardware Status screen.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, each instance of the automatic system software that you want to use this option on must be connected to your company network and have access to the directory where the Process Windows are saved.</p>

                    <p>*The <i>Centralized Process Window Control</i> option uses a unique file format for Process Windows. When the option is in use, the software will only read Process Window files that were created or converted using the <i>KIC File Administrator</i> application. ‘Standard’ Process Window files will not be recognized by the software when this option is enabled.</p>

                    <p>As this is the network location where the Process Window files will be stored, and ALL software installations will need to access this directory, you may need to contact your IT department to identify a proper location for this directory.</p>
                    <p>Once a network directory is identified, click on the <i>Browse</i> button to select the location. Click <i>OK</i> in the selection window, then click <i>Apply</i> to save the change. Two subfolders named <i>Ovens</i> and <i>ProcessSpecs</i> will automatically be generated in the specified directory. All new Process Windows created, and any existing ones that are converted to the compatible format, will be saved into the <i>ProcessSpecs</i> folder of this <i>Working Directory</i> location.</p>

                    <p>This section enables you to easily convert any existing Process Window files you already have into the updated format so they can be used with the <i>Centralized Process Window Control</i> option. To update existing files:</p>

                    <p>Click on the <i>Browse</i> button and point to the <i>ProcessSpecs</i> sub-folder of the software directory (<span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">C:\ProBot\ProcessSpecs)</span>. Click the <i>Apply</i> button. All Process Windows files (.KIC247ProcessSpec) will be automatically copied, converted into the new format (.ASCentralProcessSpec), and then pasted into the <i>ProcessSpecs</i> folder of the <i>Working Directory</i> on the network. To ensure all of your Process Windows are updated and available, repeat these same steps for each PC where you have the automatic system software installed.</p>
