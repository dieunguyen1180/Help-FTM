                    <p class="p_4">There major hardware components to the basic system:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>DAU (Data Acquisition Unit)</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>Board sensor</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="DAU"></a>DAU</h3>
                    <p>The DAU interfaces with the computer using an Ethernet cross-over cable that connects from the UpLink port on the device directly to a USB to Ethernet adapter (or to an installed Network Interface Card (NIC)).  Please follow manufacturers’ instructions to install the USB adapter or NIC.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The computer used with the WPI system can be a machine that is dedicated to only supporting WPI or it can also serve as the machine controller PC.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The DAU must be plugged into an AC power source.  It utilizes a universal A/C transformer power supply and ships from the factory with multiple AC connectors to accommodate any connector/voltage requirement.</p>
                    <p class="ListBullet2">&#160;</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Probes"></a>Probes</h3>
                    <p>The probes are mounted in the oven process chamber.  They are usually suspended from the conveyor rails by oven manufacturer approved brackets.  The probes are connected to the DAU – EVEN/ODD ports, and each probe connector is stamped with an <b>E</b> or <b>O</b> in order to designate the <b>EVEN</b> or <b>ODD</b> numbered probe TCs.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Conveyor_speed_encoder"></a>Conveyor Speed Encoder</h3>
                    <p>The conveyor speed encoder is mounted to read pulses from a gear that turns while the conveyor is operating.  The conveyor speed encoder connects by default to channel #1 of the DAU Sensor ports.</p>
                    <p class="ListBullet2">&#160;</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Board_sensor"></a>Board Sensor</h3>
                    <p>The board sensor is mounted near the entrance of the machine, typically on the fixed rail, and provides for product tracking.  It is connected by default to channel #2 of the DAU Sensor ports. Dual lane systems use a separate board sensor for each lane.</p>
                    <p class="ListBullet2">&#160;</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Additional Hardware</h3>
                    <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Using_a_profiler"></a>Profiler </h3>
                    <p class="p_4">The profiler is the data acquisition component of the system.&#160; It provides the on-board, through-the-process temperature data.&#160; The software analyzes this data together with oven zone temperature and conveyor speed factors to display the thermal profile graphically. </p>
                    <p class="p_4">You can use software with several profiler models such as:</p>
                    <ol start="1">
                        <li>
                            <p>SPS Smart Profiler</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="li_2">X<sup>5</sup></li>
                        <li class="li_2">K<sup>2</sup></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The software works the same with any of the profilers.  Once you have the software running, you indicate your specific profiler model.  The program then displays the text and graphics that reflect the model you chose.  When afterward running the program, the text and graphics that appear reflect the model you selected.  (The artwork that appears throughout this manual reflects a variety of profiler models.)</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p class="p_4">Profilers can operate in either of two modes—datalog and wireless.  In standard datalog mode, the profiler records temperature data as it moves through the thermal process.  A cable then transfers the data to your software application computer.  In wireless mode, the profiler transmits data directly to the computer by radio signals or Wi-Fi instead of an attached cable.  The application software can then display the accumulating data in real-time.</p>
                    <p class="Important_1">For specific information regarding your profiler, consult one of the following publications:</p>

                    <p>It is critical that all system hardware be installed and configured properly.  Any malfunctioning or incorrectly setup component may prevent the system from providing accurate data or from running Virtual Profiling.</p>

                    <h2 class="Heading2">Dual Lane Systems</h2>
                    <p>The automatic system can monitor production through dual lane reflow ovens. Dual lane functionality supports two control configurations:</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Dual Lane <i>Dual System</i></li>
                        <li>Dual Lane <i>Single System</i></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>A <i>Dual Lane-Dual System</i> configuration uses two instances of the software application and hardware to track different recipes through the oven.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The <i>Dual Lane-Single System</i> tracks two lanes of the same recipe with one instance of the software. A separate license is required for Dual Lane Single System use.</p>
