                    <p><i>Virtual Profiling</i> (VP) is a means of reliably predicting the thermal profile <i>of every board in a production</i> run based on a comparison of real-time temperature and conveyor speed data against a baseline profile established by an earlier profiler run through the machine.  For a given product, this baseline needs to represent an optimum machine recipe with a good PWI value and a quality soldering result.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>During the profiler run, the WPI software simultaneously collects temperature data from the board, from the probes installed at product level, and the other installed sensors. The software calculates a mathematical correlation between these temperature readings and stores this data as part of the baseline profile.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>Once the baseline is established, the WPI software can be put into inspection mode, recording real-time speed and temperature data as a production run of the same boards passes through the machine.  Comparing real-time data to the baseline profile, WPI algorithms accurately extrapolate a simulated thermal profile for each board.  WPI updates and saves the VP profile data as each board exits the machine, creating a valuable quality assurance record of each production unit.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>During inspection mode (VP), the software displays each boards profile chart and a table of data based on its process window.  Other screens show PWI and SPC control charts.  When machine data varies significantly from the baseline profile, WPI displays appropriate warnings to system operators.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Note:</b>  Before you start Virtual Profiling, ensure the WPI system hardware is properly installed and configured.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Getting_a_valid_baseline"></a>Get a Valid Baseline Profile</h2>
                    <p>Virtual Profiling makes use of a special profile, called the baseline profile, as the data model for its predictions.  The software requires that you first establish this baseline before it enables Virtual Profiling. The baseline profile should represent your optimum machine recipe for your product and needs to meet the Virtual Profile criteria shown below:</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>The PWI must be below the Maximum PWI to allow the VP value as set in Global Preferences.</li>
                        <li>The conveyor speed measured by the encoder must be within 20% of the specified conveyor speed.</li>
                        <li>Probe temperatures must be valid; if any probe thermocouple reports a range of greater than 30C between adjacent readings (every 2.5 seconds), the WPI software will consider them invalid.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>If your profile meets the above criteria, it can work as a baseline profile.  The baseline profile will display differently in the Profile Explorer screen—the profile’s icon will have an overlying green VP.<![CDATA[  ]]><img src="Resources/Images/SFT-324000-000 RPI User Manual/06000073.png" style="width: 24px;height: 24px;" /></p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>If you suspect the current baseline profile needs replacement by a newer version that more closely matches current production conditions, the software lets you create a new baseline during ongoing production.  As long as this <i>verification profile</i> meets VP criteria, it can become the new baseline profile. See <a href="Monitoring_production_in_live_mode.htm#Verifying_the_Virtual" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Verify the Virtual Profile</a>.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Integrate_Empty_Oven_Data"></a>Integrate Empty Machine Data</h3>
                    <p>For a baseline to work as a good predictive model, it needs to use temperature data that reflect both <i>board present</i> and <i>board absent</i> states along the length of the probes.  To obtain this data most efficiently, KIC recommends running the profile board with similar <i>boards moving ahead of it and an empty conveyor behind it</i>.  The downstream flow of boards stabilizes the temperatures and gives a good approximation of normal production conditions.  As the profile board progresses, the probes can measure the temperature when a board is not present.  The software can integrate this comparative data for a more accurate predictive capability.  The machine should remain empty until the profiler and board completely exits the process chamber.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><span class="span_7">Note</span>: Be aware of the potential to put the system into a state where the software lacks sufficient empty machine data to make reliable VP predictions.  The condition can occur during a verification profile run where you insert the profile board into an ongoing production flow.  With other boards both ahead of and behind the profile board, no interval for gathering empty machine data occurs.  A grey crystal ball indicates an unable to predict state.

                    <p>WPI includes a utility that lets you identify and group together different products that share the same thermal profile.  For example, one might use a physically identical printed circuit board to manufacture many distinct product models.  The manufacturer needs to specifically identify and track all the different models, but the thermal process specifications used to solder or cure them is identical throughout the product range.  Once a successful process window setup is identified for one model, the Profile Grouping utility lets you <i>link</i> that setup with other models that can use the same process and thus save the time and cost of entering the same setup specifications repeatedly.  In Virtual Profile mode, the baseline profile of a <i>parent product</i> can be matched to multiple <i>child models</i>, permitting smooth production transitions between models.</p>
