                    <p>Thermocouples (TCs), attached to solder joints or other important sites on the board, directly measure the temperature at the point that the TC bead is in contact with the PCB.  The TC measurements are collected by the profiler and the KIC software to create thermal profiles.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>Two methods are typically used to attach TCs—<i>aluminum tape and high temperature solder</i>.  Both methods are discussed below.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The system works with multiple TCs— <i>Air TC, Dwell TCs, and Product TCs</i> – depending on what type of data you want to collect.  Product TCs record the temperature data for various sites on the board.  The Air TC gets specific positioning because its temperature <i>triggers the start of the profile</i> data processing, aids with data alignment, and is used in the prediction capabilities of the software. Dwell TCs will be used for collecting contact time in the wave.</p>

                    <p><b>Live Reading</b> – When the KIC profiler is on and communicating with the software, you will see live temperature updates for the TCs plugged into the KIC profiler.  The TC checkbox must be selected for each TC you are using to view the temperature readings.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Battery Voltage</b> –Displays the live readings of the KIC profiler battery voltage.  The software will recognize if your battery voltage is too low and will not allow you to start a profile until you have batteries with enough voltage to complete the profile.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Profiler Internal Temperature</b> – Displays the internal temperature of the KIC profiler.  If the temperature is too high to complete the profile and stay under the maximum rating for the unit, it will not allow you to start the profile.  You must wait until the KIC profiler is cool enough.  The software will let you know what temperature you will have to cool below.</p>

                    <p>The WPI software has automatic (Navigator), and manual prediction capabilities.  Manual prediction gives you the flexibility to easily predict changes to the machine settings (temperature settings, conveyor speed), and view the results without having to spend the time actually running unnecessary profiles.  This feature is very helpful to you, minimizing the time spent fine-tuning or developing a thermal profile.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Make Changes</h3>
                    <p>To predict changes to the machine settings, or modify the Navigator prediction results, click on the zone you wish to change.  In the example below, zone 1 has been selected.  See Figure .</p>

                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The Navigator prediction tool will predict the results of that change, and then automatically update the PWI, predicted Statistics, and the profile graph.  The new predicted results appear on the graph in a dotted-line format.  This format lets you quickly determine the difference between the original and predicted profiles.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><span class="span_7">Note</span>: When separate Top and Bottom setpoints are used, the Navigator prediction will maintain the same delta between the Top and Bottom setting that was used in the original profile.</p>
