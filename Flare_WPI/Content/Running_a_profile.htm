                    <p>Thermocouples (TCs), attached to solder joints or other important sites on the board, directly measure the temperature at the point that the TC bead is in contact with the PCB.  The TC measurements are collected by the profiler and the KIC software to create thermal profiles.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>Two methods are typically used to attach TCs—<i>aluminum tape and high temperature solder</i>.  Both methods are discussed below.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The system works with multiple TCs—<i>Air TC, Dwell TCs, and Product TCs</i> – depending on what type of data the user want to collect.  Product TCs record the temperature data for various sites on the board.  The Air TC gets specific positioning because its temperature <i>triggers the start of the profile</i> data processing, aids with data alignment, and is used in the prediction capabilities of the software. Dwell TCs will be used for collecting contact time in the wave.</p>

                    <p><b>Include Thermocouple (TC) Labels (20 char. Max)</b> – Checking this will display a field below each TC that is selected.  Up to 20 characters can be used to describe the placement or description of the TC.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>TC Check Boxes</b> – Used to select each TC channel going to be used for the profile.  TC number 1 is always used as the “Air TC”.  If <i style="font-weight: bold;">Wave On</i> is selected, channels 2 and 3 are used to calculate <i>Dwell Time</i> and will automatically be selected and labeled (as shown above). The user must use at least one more TC as well.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Distance From The Air TC</b> – For <i style="font-weight: bold;">Wave On</i> profiles, user specified location of the TCs, relative to the “Air TC”, is required.  Entering these values allows the software to automatically align the data to the proper positioning. Click the tape measure button for an example of how to determine the distance correctly.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p><b>Live Reading</b> – When the KIC profiler is communicating with the software, the user will see live temperature updates for the TCs plugged into the KIC profiler.  The TC’s checkbox must be selected to view that TC’s temperature readings.</p>

                    <p><b>Battery</b> – Displays the live readings of the KIC profiler battery voltage.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><b>Note:</b> The software will recognize if the battery voltage is too low and will not allow the user to start a profile until the profiler batteries have enough voltage to complete the profile.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><b>Profiler Internal Temperature</b> – Displays the internal temperature of the KIC profiler.  If the temperature is too high to complete the profile and stay under the maximum rating for the unit, it will not allow the user to start the profile.  The user must wait until the KIC profiler is cool enough.  The software will let the user know what temperature the profiler will have to cool below.</p>
