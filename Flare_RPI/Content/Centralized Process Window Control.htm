        <p>This optional feature enables a customer to ensure that every instance of the software is always using the same Process Window files and prevents unauthorized editing of specifications. Many factories may have multiple systems and the same Process Windows may need to be used at any one of those systems. This can lead to mistakes being made during file transfer from one machine to another. Another issue arises when someone makes a change to a specification on one machine, and the change may not be made on others, or the updated file is not copied to all other software. This can lead to varying profile results depending on which PC the data is collected in.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This feature eliminates these situations by ‘centralizing’ the creation and editing of Process Window files through the use of a separate application, accessible only by authorized personnel. All Process Window files reside in a specified central directory, and each instance of the RPI software gets their Process Windows from this location. Additionally, all creation and editing functions of the Process Window within the RPI software are disabled. This ensures that no matter who is running the profile or at which location, the correct, approved Process Window specifications are the only ones available.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><b>Note</b>: For the Centralized Process Window Control to function, the appropriately programmed USB dongle key must remain connected to the PC at all times during use. You can verify if you have the optional feature by viewing the Software Key panel in the Hardware Status screen.</p>
            <p>Additionally, each instance of the RPI software that you want to use this option on must be connected to your company network and have access to the directory where the Process Windows are saved.</p>

Click the <i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Apply</i> button. All Process Windows files (.KIC247ProcessSpec) will be automatically copied, converted into the new format (.ASCentralProcessSpec), and then pasted into the <i style="font-family: 'Courier New';">ProcessSpecs</i> folder of the <i style="font-family: 'Courier New';">Working Directory</i> on the network. To ensure all of your Process Windows are updated and available, repeat these same steps for each PC where you have the RPI software installed.</p>

        <p>To use the <i>Centralized Process Window Control</i> option in the RPI software, a selection needs to be made during the software installation. This will automatically configure the software to use this function. A message will appear on the screen to plug in your USB dongle:</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When a valid key with the option included is detected, an additional prompt will appear allowing you to ‘disable’ the CPWC function, or continue with including the CPWC configuration:</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>After installation of the RPI software is completed, you will also need to specify the network directory where the Process Window files will be retrieved from. This will be done through the <i style="font-family: 'Courier New';">ConfigurationProgram.exe</i> utility:</p>

        <p>When the <i>Centralized Process Window</i> option is in use, the RPI software will populate the drop-down menu at the top of the screen with <b style="font-style: italic;">only</b> the Process Window files from the specified network directory.

        <p>The Process Window files will automatically be downloaded into the local RPI directory from the specified network location.
