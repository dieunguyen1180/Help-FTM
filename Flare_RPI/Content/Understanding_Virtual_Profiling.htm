                    <p>Virtual Profiling (VP) is a means of reliably predicting the thermal profile <i>of every board in a production run</i> based on a comparison of real-time temperature and conveyor speed data against a <i>baseline</i> profile established by an earlier profiler run through the oven.  For a given product, this baseline needs to represent an optimum oven recipe with a good PWI value and a quality soldering result.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>During the profiler run, RPI software simultaneously collects temperature data from the board and from the probes installed in the oven at product level. The software calculates a mathematical correlation between these temperature readings and stores this data as part of the baseline profile.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>Once the baseline is established, the RPI software goes into monitoring mode, recording real-time belt speed and probe temperature data as a production run of similar boards passes through the oven.  Comparing real-time data to the baseline profile, RPI algorithms accurately extrapolate a simulated thermal profile, or <i>Virtual Profile</i>, for each board.  RPI updates and saves this VP profile data as each board exits the oven, creating a valuable quality assurance record of each production unit.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>In monitoring mode, the software displays each board’s profile chart and a table of data based on its process window.&#160; Other screens show PWI and SPC control charts.&#160; When oven data varies significantly from the baseline profile, RPI displays appropriate warnings to system operators. </p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p class="ListContinue2"><span class="span_7">Note</span>:&#160; Before you start Virtual Profiling, ensure all of the RPI system hardware is properly installed and configured:</p>

                    <p>Virtual Profiling makes use of a special profile, called the <i>baseline</i> profile, as the data model for its predictions.  The software requires that you first establish this baseline before it enables Virtual Profiling. The baseline profile should represent your optimum oven recipe for your product and needs to meet the Virtual Profile criteria shown below.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <ul class="ul_3">
                        <li class="ListBullet3_1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The PWI must be below the Maximum PWI to allow the VP value as set in Global Preferences.</li>
                        <li class="ListBullet3_1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The conveyor speed measured by the encoder must be within 20% of the specified conveyor speed.</li>
                        <li class="ListBullet3_1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Probe temperatures must be valid; if any probe thermocouple reports a range of greater than 30<span class="span_11">°</span>C between adjacent readings (every 2.5 seconds), the RPI software will consider them invalid.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your profile meets the above criteria, it can work as a baseline profile.  The baseline profile will display differently in the Profile Explorer screen—the profile’s icon will have an overlying green VP.  <img src="Resources/Images/SFT-324000-000 RPI User Manual/06000073.png" style="width: 24px;height: 24px;" /></p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>If you suspect the current baseline profile needs replacement by a newer version that more closely matches current production conditions, the software lets you create a new baseline during ongoing production.  As long as this <i>verification profile</i> meets VP criteria, it can become the new baseline profile.&#160; See <a href="Monitoring_production_in_live_mode.htm#Verifying_the_Virtual" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Verify the Virtual Profile</a>.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Integrate_Empty_Oven_Data"></a>Integrate Empty Oven Data</h3>
                    <p>For a baseline to work as a good predictive model, it needs to use temperature data that reflect both <u>board present</u> and <span class="span_6">board absent</span> states along the length of the probes.&#160; To obtain this data most efficiently, KIC recommends running the profiler board with similar <span class="span_6">boards </span><span class="span_6">moving ahead</span> <span class="span_6">of it </span><span class="span_6">and an empty conveyor </span><span class="span_6">behind</span><span class="span_6"> it</span><span class="span_6">.</span>&#160; The downstream flow of boards stabilizes the oven temperature and gives a good approximation of normal production conditions.&#160; As the profiler board exits each oven zone, the probes can measure the temperature when a board is not present.&#160; The software can integrate this comparative data for a more accurate predictive capability.&#160; The oven should remain empty until the profiler board completely exits the process chamber.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p class="ListContinue2"><span class="span_7">Note</span>: Be aware of the potential to put the system into a state where the software lacks sufficient empty oven data to make reliable VP predictions.  The condition can occur during a verification profile run where you insert the profiler board into an ongoing production flow.  With other boards both ahead of and behind the profiler board, no interval for gathering empty oven data occurs.  A grey crystal ball indicates an unable to predict state.&#160; See <a href="Monitoring_production_in_live_mode.htm" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Monitoring production in live mode</a>.</p>
