                    <p>The RPI (Reflow Process Index) system is a comprehensive suite of thermal process management tools designed to give you the ultimate in PCB soldering quality control. KIC RPI can monitor the entire thermal process, giving advanced warning before a product drifts out of specification.  Its barcode control features can prevent costly product/recipe mismatches, and its power management features enable efficient operation at the lowest energy cost.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>RPI combines software and hardware components into an integrated system. The software supplements its thermal profile analysis core with special tools for performance optimization, changed variable prediction, and data file management. The RPI hardware includes thermocouple probes that measure oven temperature, sensors to track product movement and conveyor speed, a profiler to move through the process accumulating thermal data, an Ethernet communication hub, and alarm system.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Understanding_the1"></a>The hardware</h2>
                    <p class="p_6">The major hardware components to an RPI system are:</p>
                    <ul class="ul_3">
                        <li>
                            <p>DAU (Data Acquisition Unit)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="li_1">Probes</li>
                        <li class="li_1">Conveyor speed encoder</li>
                        <li class="li_1">Board sensor</li>
                        <li class="li_1">Alarm Relay/Light Tower</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">DAU</h3>
                    <p>The DAU interfaces with the computer using an Ethernet cross-over cable that connects from the UpLink port on the device directly to a USB to Ethernet adapter (or to an installed Network Interface Card (NIC)).  Please follow manufacturers’ instructions to install the USB adapter or NIC.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The computer used with the WPI system can be a machine that is dedicated to only supporting WPI or it can also serve as the machine controller PC.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The DAU must be plugged into an AC power source.  It utilizes a universal A/C transformer power supply and ships from the factory with multiple AC connectors to accommodate any connector/voltage requirement.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Probes</h3>
                    <p>The probes are mounted in the oven process chamber.  They are usually suspended from the conveyor rails by oven manufacturer approved brackets.  The probes are connected to the DAU – EVEN/ODD ports, and each probe connector is stamped with an <b>E</b> or <b>O</b> in order to designate the <b>EVEN</b> or <b>ODD</b> numbered probe TCs.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Conveyor speed encoder</h3>
                    <p>The conveyor speed encoder is mounted to read pulses from a gear that turns while the conveyor is operating.  The conveyor speed encoder connects by default to channel #1 of the DAU Sensor ports.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Board Sensor</h3>
                    <p>The board sensor is mounted near the entrance of the machine, typically on the fixed rail, and provides for product tracking.  It is connected by default to channel #2 of the DAU Sensor ports. Dual lane systems use a separate board sensor for each lane.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Alarm Relay</h3>
                    <p>The Alarm Relay connects to the Alarm/Barcode port of the DAU and allows for integration to an infeed conveyor (available with SMEMA interface connections) to prevent products from entering machine when an alarm condition occurs or hardwiring to an external device of your choosing. Additionally, it allows for a standard KIC supplied audible light tower to be powered and triggered. The Alarm Relay is required to have an external AC power source</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Light Tower </h3>
                    <p>There are two audible light towers available – one model connects directly to the Alarm Relay device; the other model connects directly to the USB port of the PC.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Additional Hardware</h3>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Profiler
                    </h3>
                    <p>The profiler is the data acquisition component of the RPI system.  It provides the on-board, through-the-process temperature data.  RPI analyzes this data together with oven zone temperature and conveyor speed factors to graphically display the thermal profile. The following profiler models are compatible with the system:</p>
                    <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
                        <li class="li_2">SPS Smart Profiler</li>
                        <li class="li_2">X<sup>5</sup></li>
                        <li>
                            <p>K<sup>2</sup></p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The software works the same with any of the profilers.  Once you have the software running, you indicate your specific profiler model.  (The artwork that appears throughout this manual reflects a variety of profiler models.)</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>Profilers can operate in either of two modes—datalog and wireless.  In standard datalog mode, the profiler records temperature data as it moves through the thermal process.  A cable then transfers the data to your KIC software computer.  In wireless mode, the profiler transmits data directly to the computer by radio signals or Wi-Fi instead of an attached cable.  KIC software can then display the accumulating data in real-time.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>For specific information regarding your profiler, consult one of the following KIC publications:</p>

                    <h3 class="Heading3">Barcode Reader</h3>
                    <p>A user-supplied, serial port barcode reader connects to the DAU Alarm/Barcode port.  When both the Alarm Relay and a serial port barcode reader are used, the barcode reader hardware can be connected using the Alarm Relay Y- cable. Alternately, a USB barcode reader can connect through one of the DAUs built-in USB ports. For additional information about using scanners, see <a href="Appendix_C.htm#Barcode_Tab"><i>Appendix C – Barcode Tab.</i></a></p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Dual Lane Functionality
                 </h3>
                    <p class="p_6">The RPI system can monitor production through dual lane reflow ovens.  A <i>Dual Lane Dual System</i> configuration uses two instances of the software and hardware application with the ability to track different recipes through the two lanes of the oven.  The <i>Dual Lane Single System</i> tracks two lanes of the same recipe with one instance of the software and hardware.  A radio button selection during the installation routine lets you choose between the standard configuration or one of the dual lane setups (a separate license is required for <i>Dual Lane Single System</i> use).  For more information, see the section titled <a href="Dual_Lane_Systems_and_Functionality.htm#Using_dual_lane_systems">Dual Lane Systems</a>.</p>

                    <p>It is critical that all RPI hardware is properly installed and configured.  If one of the system components is setup incorrectly or is malfunctioning, the RPI system will not allow you to run Virtual Profiling or provide accurate data.  If you have any questions or are unsure about any of the following, contact KIC Technical Support for assistance: <u style="color: #0000cd;"><a href="mailto:tech@kicmail.com">tech@kicmail.com</a></u></p>

                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Installing_the_software"></a>The Software
                    </h2>
                    <p>The RPI optimization tools include <i>Navigator, Auto-Focus</i>, and <i>Power</i>.  Data management tools include <i>Live Data Output and Remote Process Monitoring</i>.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Navigator
                    </h3>
                    <p>The KIC Navigator is a prediction tool that automatically finds the optimal oven setup for each product you profile.  Navigator lets you understand how changes to belt speed and oven setpoints will affect a product profile. The KIC Navigator can create and evaluate billions of potential product profiles, automatically selecting the profile and oven setup that best fits the Process Window. This automated prediction tool is exponentially more powerful and accurate than any tool currently on the market and allows you to find the optimal profile in about a minute. The automated prediction tool is designed to center the profile in your process window, and you may set the limits to fit your process. An example of this is running sensitive components with lead-free solders: if your assembly cannot see temperatures above 235°C, but must see a fairly high peak temperature to reflow the lead-free solder, the KIC Navigator will find a profile that will be centered between the high and low limits.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the most significant feature of RPI and KIC Navigator is that they rank your profiles using the <i>Process Window Index</i>.  This allows you to compare performance between processes and, more importantly, to be assured that you have found the most robust and reliable profile for a given product that your oven can achieve.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Auto-Focus
                    </h3>
                    <p><i>Auto-Focus</i> is simulation software that eliminates the need to guess at an initial oven recipe.  Auto-Focus automatically calculates the ideal oven recipe, allowing you to avoid conventional oven setup pitfalls.  Auto Focus gets smarter with every profile you run, providing you with increasingly accurate oven recipes.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Navigator/Auto Focus Power
                    </h3>
                    <p>Used with Navigator and Auto-Focus software, the Power feature optimizes your profiles and/or initial oven settings based on reduced energy use.  Studies have shown that many reflow ovens and wave machines consume more energy than required in order to process the products in spec. The KIC Navigator Power and Auto-Focus Power functions identify the oven or wave solder recipes that consume the least amount of energy while processing the products in spec. The result is improved quality at reduced energy costs.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Live Data Output
                    </h3>
                    <p>Live Data Output (LDO) processes data for every board as real-time output for use with third-party applications.  Third-party software can provide line balancing, production host monitoring or statistical process control.</p>
                    <h3 class="Heading3">Remote Process Monitoring
                    </h3>
                    <p>The Remote Process Monitoring (RPM) system distributes real-time thermal process information for display on a server anywhere on your network. When a software system installed at an oven includes RPM, it monitors the process and transmits real-time data for each production board as an output. Each output includes the oven name, product name, <i>Process Window Index</i> (PWI), real-time <i>Process Capability Index</i> (Cpk), and the current alarm status, including the text and light bar state.  As each board exists the oven, its data output is sent to a computer provisioned with <i>RPM server software</i>. This RPM server can display the data and act as the distribution hub for a network of viewing terminals. With the appropriate software installed, these additional networked computers can access the data from the main RPM server and display it on their own monitors. RPM software can display data as an iconic status overview of the whole production floor, individual oven process histories, or graphs charting the last 100 production units.</p>
