                    <p>The RPI software can be configured to write the collected data (oven files, process windows, profiles and historical VP data) to a network drive location.  This would allow data from one or even multiple systems to be stored in one centralized location (Server/Shared Hard Drive).</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p class="p_6">The first step necessary is to map a network drive from the PC running the RPI software to the desired network location.  Due to the multiple varieties of OS and network configurations, KIC cannot detail this step.  We recommend you contact your IT/Network administrator for setting this up.  Below is a typical example of this setup.  See Figure 155.</p>

                    <p>The operating parameters of a reflow oven are specified by the manufacturer in the oven controller.  These parameters may include zone setpoint temperatures, conveyor speed, fan speed, Nitrogen On/Off, conveyor width, etc.  Taken together, these parameters form a Base Oven Recipe, which RPI uses as a set of default values.</p>
                    <p>RPI can set/load the zone setpoint temperatures and the conveyor speed parameters, adjusting them from the default values in the Base Oven Recipe.</p>

                    <p>In order for the engineer to specify the other parameters, a Base Oven Recipe must be created.  This oven recipe has all the oven parameters except the zone set point temperatures and conveyor speed set correctly.  When you load a Virtual Profile for a given product, this software will modify the set points and conveyor speed in the Base Oven Recipe, and then load the Base Oven Recipe into the oven controller.  In this way, the oven will be setup exactly as it was during the Baseline Profile.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>When running profiles with oven communications, be aware of the following differences when compared to regular operations:</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When running a profile and going through the sequence of screens leading up to the Select Thermocouple screen, you will not see a pull-down menu for the oven since there can be only one.  You will also not see the screen for the oven settings since this was taken care of in Global Preferences.<br /><br /></li>
                        <li>When you are running the software with oven communication, the software sends data to the oven’s PC control software.  This communication seems transparent at first, but once you gain more experience you will see certain signs that the KIC software and the oven controller are communicating.  One of the first things you might notice is that the recipe name loaded on the oven controller software will be KICPROFILE.  Loading the KICPROFILE recipe provides the benefit of giving the KIC software a vehicle to update oven settings without having to call a specific recipe file name and location of an oven controller recipe.<br /><br /></li>
                        <li>When running a profile, the software uses a Base Oven Recipe as a starting point for the oven recipe then changes the name to KICPROFILE and will/can only change the zone setpoints and conveyor speed settings thereafter.  This gives the software the flexibility to change setpoints and conveyor speed on the fly without having you manually rename or save the recipe file.<br /><br /></li>
                        <li>For your first profile, load appropriate temperature and conveyor speed settings in the oven control software.  Once you have run your first profile or have loaded an existing profile from the Profile Explorer zone setpoints, you can make conveyor speed adjustments manually while viewing the profile or let it happen automatically if you have the Navigator software option installed.<br /><br />Once you choose to run a profile using the predicted setpoints and conveyor speed?, the software automatically sends these new settings to the oven controller software to be loaded.  When the new settings are loaded, watch for the following:<br /><br /></li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>With some oven controllers there may be an audio warning, indicating that the oven is going to change settings.  Some of the audio indicators are also accompanied by a timer that will not allow the oven to load the new setpoints until the programmed time has elapsed.  These timers can be reduced or turned off at the customer’s discretion.</li>

                        <li>If you are starting a profile and the software tells you that the oven’s actual zone temperatures are not within 2 degrees of the of the setpoint value, and you know that you have waited long enough (possibly even answered that they are still changing), but now you know they are not, then you will have to answer <i>No</i> and follow the instructions. This information is outlined in the user manual, but what happens next may be a little confusing to a first time user. Here is a list of what takes place and why<br /><br /></li>

                        <li>You answer <b style="font-style: italic;">No</b> the temperatures are not getting closer and the system then asks you to change the Setpoint values to that of the Actual. What the system is doing by this is finding out what the oven will actually control to in certain zones.  It then takes the differences and uses them to update the oven.ini file so the next time the system optimizes for a profile it will take the zone delta limitations that it learned and apply it to the next profile.  The software will use the new zone delta limits until the values change again by a set of oven setpoints that can’t be maintained by the oven are chosen. Remember that it is very important that you are sure that the oven can’t achieve the original setpoints before you answer <b style="font-style: italic;">No</b>. Once the new delta limits are established this will affect the capability of the Navigator to optimize your profiles.</li>

                        <li>Next the software will prompt you that it will calculate new setpoints.  When you click on OK, the screen will change to a profile graph that has calculated new oven setpoints for the oven to load in order to produce the optimized profile results.  This works the same even if you don’t have the Navigator  option.  If you entered the new setpoints manually the software will automatically find new setpoints like the Navigator would when you get to this point.  Be patient you may have to go through this cycle of the oven not controlling to setpoint values a few times before the proper combination of acceptable setpoints and profile optimization can be found.  In worst case scenarios you may have to change the 2.0 degrees delta between setpoint and actual because the oven is just simply not capable of getting within 2 degrees C of the setpoint no matter what the temperature.  Please contact KIC Tech support if this is the case.<br /><br /></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Note:</b> If you get into a situation where you are having to adjust too many times and are still not getting setpoints that the oven will control to, but you are or you will be in spec by manually changing predicted setpoints, then go into the Optimization Tab and turn off “Allow Zone Setpoints To Change”.  The next time around the KIC software will not change any of the zone values but you can go in and change them manually to exactly what the actual values are and run the profile.</p>
