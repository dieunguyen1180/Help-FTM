        <h1 class="Heading1"><a name="Vacuum_Reflow_Oven_Systems"></a>Vacuum Reflow Oven Systems And Functionality</h1>
        <p>Vacuum reflow ovens typically include an extra chamber in between the heated and cooling sections of the oven. During production, the PCB travels into the vacuum zone, the chamber is sealed off from the rest of the process tunnel, and a vacuum is drawn. The chamber is opened, and then the PCB continues into the cooling section and exits the oven. The purpose of adding a vacuum chamber to the process is to reduce voiding in the formation of the solder joints. The RPI system can be integrated into select* vacuum reflow ovens. This section outlines the unique capabilities of the <i>RPI Vacuum</i> system.</p>
        <p>* <i>Contact KIC to check for compatibility with your machine</i></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In addition to the other functionality described in this manual, the <i>RPI Vacuum</i> system includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Process monitoring capabilities throughout the entire process, including the vacuum zone</li>
            <li>Time duration PCB spent in vacuum zone automatically saved with each profile</li>
            <li>Time duration PCB spent in vacuum zone automatically saved for each PCB during production</li>
            <li>A dynamic graphical display of the vacuum zone for each PCB (based on the time each PCB spent in the chamber)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Software communication with the applicable oven controller software may be required for the <i>RPI Vacuum system</i>.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Vacuum_System_Hardware"></a>RPI Vacuum System Hardware</h2>
        <p>The <i>RPI Vacuum</i> system incorporates custom built thermal probes unique to the vacuum ovens which allow for monitoring the heated zones, vacuum chamber, and cooling section to provide complete monitoring of the PCB through the process.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Display_Vacuum_Reflow_profile"></a>RPI Vacuum System Functionality</h2>
        <p>During profiling, the system identifies the duration that the PCB spent in the vacuum chamber, and the graphical display of the vacuum zone is drawn to match this time. A window is also displayed (and saved with the profile) showing how much time, in seconds, the PCB spent in the chamber.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/SFT-324000-000 RPI User Manual/0800014016.png" />
        </p>
        <p>On vacuum ovens, even if the vacuum chamber is not in use, the software will still display the vacuum zone on the graph, and show the time spent in that zone (based on length of zone defined and conveyor speed setpoint).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/SFT-324000-000 RPI User Manual/0800014017.png" />
        </p>
        <p><a name="Display_Vacuum_Reflow_VP"></a>During production, as with systems installed on non-vacuum ovens, the live-mode screen displays both the baseline and virtual profile information.  To distinguish between the two, the baseline profile appears in a solid line format, while the virtual profile appears in dashed lines.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The window showing the <i>Time in Vacuum Chamber</i> includes both the time from the baseline profile as well as the time the current production PCB spent in the chamber:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/SFT-324000-000 RPI User Manual/0800014018.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, a green line (<i>End of Vacuum Zone Indicator</i>) appears on the graph representing the calculated end of the vacuum zone. Depending on the time a given PCB spends in the chamber, this green line will shift forward or back to show the relative ‘size’ of the zone. More time in the chamber equates to a ‘longer’ zone, and less time a ‘shorter’ zone.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>As you can see in the example below, this PCB spent approximately 26 seconds less in the chamber than the baseline, so the green <i>End of Vacuum Zone</i> indicator is shifted forward to represent this ‘shorter’ zone size. Due to this, you can also see the VP (dotted lines) shows an earlier drop in the TC temperatures compared to the baseline:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/SFT-324000-000 RPI User Manual/0800014019.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In this example, the baseline profile spent much more time in the chamber, so the display of the vacuum zone is extended to represent a ‘longer’ zone:</p>
        <p>

        <h3 class="Heading3">Additional Warning for Vacuum Process</h3>
        <p>On <i>RPI Vacuum</i> systems, an additional warning can be enabled for users who want to be notified if the time that production boards spend in the vacuum chamber varies too much from their baseline profile setup.</p>

        <p>On some dual lane vacuum reflow machines, stoppers may be used by the oven manufacturer to sync up the products in the two lanes before allowing them to enter into the heated zones. In these configurations, a special function can be enabled which will alter the standard board sensor operation so that if a product is stopped (and is underneath the board sensor), the board sensor will only detect it as a single product.</p>
