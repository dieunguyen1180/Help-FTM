                    <p><i>Virtual Profiling</i> (VP) is a means of reliably predicting the thermal profile  based on a comparison of real-time temperature and conveyor speed data against a <i>baseline</i> profile established by an earlier profiler run through the oven. The software generates a Virtual Profile at <i>a user-selected interval from once per hour to once every 24 hours.</i></p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p> For a given product, this baseline needs to represent an optimum oven recipe with a good PWI value and a quality soldering result.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>During the initial profile run, the software simultaneously collects temperature data from the board and from the probes installed in the oven at product level.  The software calculates a mathematical correlation between these temperature readings and stores this data as part of the baseline profile.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>Once the baseline is established, the software goes into monitoring mode, recording real-time belt speed and probe temperature data at the specified interval as the production run passes through the oven.  Comparing real-time data to the baseline profile, the automatic system algorithms accurately extrapolate a simulated thermal profile. When oven data varies significantly from the baseline profile, the software displays appropriate warnings to system operators. The software saves the data from each profile/virtual profile, creating a valuable quality assurance record.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>If you’ve purchased the option, the software can display a chart and table of profile data based on the process window and also Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts.</p>

                    <p>Virtual Profiling makes use of a special profile, called the baseline profile, as the data model for its predictions.  The software requires that you first establish this baseline before it enables Virtual Profiling. The baseline profile should represent your optimum oven recipe for your product and needs to meet the Virtual Profile criteria shown below:</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>
                            <p>The PWI must be below the Maximum PWI to allow the VP value as set in Global Preferences.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>The conveyor speed measured by the encoder must be within 20% of the specified conveyor speed.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Probe temperatures must be valid; if any probe thermocouple reports a range of greater than 30°C between adjacent readings (every 2.5 seconds), the software will consider them invalid.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>If your profile meets the above criteria, it can work as a baseline profile. The baseline profile will display differently in the Profile Explorer screen—the profile’s icon will have an overlying green VP icon <img src="Resources/Images/image124.png"></img>.  If you suspect the current baseline profile needs replacement by a newer version that more closely matches current production conditions, the software lets you create a new baseline during ongoing production.  As long as this <i>verification profile</i> meets VP criteria, it can become the new baseline profile.  See <span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="Virtual_Profiling_VP.htm#Verifying_the_Virtual">Verify the Virtual Profile</a></span>.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>

                                </h3>
                    <p>For a baseline to work as a good predictive model, it needs to use temperature data that reflect both <i>board present</i> and <i>board absent</i> states along the length of the probes.  To obtain this data most efficiently, it may be necessary to run the profiler board with similar <i>boards moving ahead of it and an empty conveyor behind it</i>.  The downstream flow of boards stabilizes the oven temperature and gives a good approximation of normal production conditions.  As the profiler board exits each oven zone, the probes can measure the temperature when a board is not present.  The software can integrate this comparative data for a more accurate predictive capability.  The oven should remain empty until the profiler board completely exits the process chamber.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><b>Note:</b> Be aware of the potential to put the system into a state where the software lacks sufficient empty oven data to make reliable VP predictions.  The condition can occur during a verification profile run where you insert the profiler board into an ongoing production flow.  With other boards both ahead of and behind the profiler board, no interval for gathering empty oven data occurs  and Virtual Profiling will not be able to be used.</p>

                    <p>The <i>Virtual Profile</i> is a prediction of the process profile (inside the oven) generated from a model created when the Baseline profile was run.  A <i>Verification Profile</i> is a comparison run against the virtual profile model.  If you think the process has changed significantly or you have purposely changed the recipe, running a verification profile lets you verify the prediction model.  This comparison can either verify that the process profile is still within specification or create a new baseline profile based on the recent changes.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The verification profile updates the Baseline profile for the current Virtual Profile, ensuring that its prediction model yields the most accurate possible results, using the most recent profile.  The software always recognizes the latest in spec profile as the Baseline for any Virtual Profile.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The software recognizes when the process temperatures change significantly as compared to the current Baseline profile, and then prompts you to run a verification profile.  You can intentionally run a verification profile at any time during Virtual Profiling Live Mode.</p>
