                    <p>The optional <i>Alarm Relay</i> connects to the Alarm/Barcode port of the eTPU and provides an external notification to the user when an alarm condition occurs. It allows for an optional audible light tower to be powered and triggered; can include SMEMA interface connections; and it allows a user to hardwire in an external device of their choosing. The Alarm Relay is required to have an external AC power source.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Light_Tower"></a>Light Tower
                    </h2>
                    <p>There are two available light towers – one is connected directly to the optional Alarm Relay and uses a single Red light; the other connects to the USB port of the PC, and uses 3 colored lights – Red, Yellow, and Green.</p>
                    <p>Both lights are a means of providing an audio or visual cue when the automatic system software has determined that the oven process has reached an out-of-control condition.</p>
