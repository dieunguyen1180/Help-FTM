                    </p>
                    <h1 class="Heading1">Software Options</h1>
                    <p>The <i>optional profile</i> optimization tools include <i>Navigator Power,</i> <i>Auto-Focus Power, and Sweet Spot. Optional process monitoring tools include, SPC Charting. Optional</i> data management tools include <i>Live Data Output</i>.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Navigator"></a>Navigator </h2>
                    <p><i>Navigator</i> is a prediction tool that automatically finds the optimal oven setup for each product you profile.  <i>Navigator</i> lets you understand how changes to belt speed and oven set points will affect a product profile by evaluating billions of potential recipes settings, automatically selecting the profile and oven setup that best fits the Process Window.  This automated prediction tool is exponentially more powerful and accurate than any tool currently on the market and allows you to find the optimal profile in about a minute.  The automated prediction tool is designed to center the profile in your process window, and you may set the limits to fit your process.  An example of this is running sensitive components with lead-free solders: if your assembly cannot see temperatures above 235°C but must see a fairly high peak temperature to reflow the lead-free solder, <i>Navigator</i> will find a profile that will be centered between the high and low limits.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the most significant feature of the software and the <i>Navigator</i> tool is that they rank your profiles using the <i>Process Window Index</i>.  This allows you to compare performance between processes and, more importantly, to be assured that you have found the most robust and reliable profile for a given product that your oven can achieve.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Auto_Focus"></a>Auto-Focus </h2>
                    <p><i>Auto Focus</i> is a simulation software that eliminates the need to guess at an initial oven recipe.  <i>Auto-Focus</i> automatically calculates the ideal oven recipe, allowing you to avoid conventional oven setup pitfalls.  <i>Auto-Focus</i> gets smarter with every profile you run, providing you with increasingly accurate oven recipes.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Navigator_Auto_Focus"></a>Navigator/Auto&#8209;Focus Power</h2>
                    <p>Used with <i>Navigator</i> and <i>Auto-Focus</i> software, the <i>Power</i> feature optimizes your profiles and/or initial oven settings based on reduced energy use.  Studies have shown that many reflow ovens consume more energy than required in order to process the products in spec.  The <i>Navigator Power</i> and <i>Auto-Focus Power</i> functions identify the oven recipes that consume the least amount of energy while processing the products in spec.  The result is improved quality at reduced energy costs.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Sweet_Spot"></a>Sweet Spot
                    </h2>
                    <p>The <i>Sweet Spot</i> feature allows you to define a “non-centered” target value for your statistical calculations.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Dual_Profiling_Mode"></a>Dual Profiling Mode</h2>
                    <p><i>Dual Profiling</i> is an <i>optional</i> hardware and software capability that allows you to record profiles using up to 24 thermocouples. It utilizes two (2) standard 12 channel SPS Smart profilers which will be ‘paired’ to each other and are run using a <i>‘dual’</i> thermal shield which accommodates both units. It is designed for applications where a larger number of TCs are required, but still offers the flexibility to run a single 12 channel unit by itself as needed.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Statistical_Process_Control_Charts"></a>Statistical Process Control Charts
                    </h2>
                    <p><i>Statistical Process Control</i> (SPC) charts provide graphical data of the key process parameters that need to be monitored for product quality assurance.  SPC charts aid the ability to understand the predictability of the process and to know in real-time when a process may be changing and affect product quality.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Live_Data_Output1"></a>Live Data Output</h2>
                    <p><i>Live Data Output</i> (LDO) processes data for every virtual profile as real-time output for use with third-party applications.  Third-party software can provide line balancing, production host monitoring or statistical process control.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Centralized_Process_Window_Control"></a>Centralized Process Window Control</h2>
                    <p>This optional feature enables a customer to ensure that every instance of the software is always using the same Process Window files and prevents unauthorized editing of specifications.</p>
