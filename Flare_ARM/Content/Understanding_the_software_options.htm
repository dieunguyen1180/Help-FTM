                    <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 20pt;font-weight: bold;color: #4682b4;">Part 2: Software and Hardware Options</p>
                    <h1 class="Heading1"><a name="Software"></a>Software Options</h1>
                    <p>The <i>optional profile</i> optimization tools include <i>Navigator Power, Auto-Focus Power, and Sweet Spot. Optional process monitoring tools include Live Index, SPC Charting, Troubleshooting Tab, O2 Live, VP Idle Mode, Barcode, and Lot ID. Optional</i> data management tools include <i>Live Data Output, Remote Process Monitoring, and Centralized Process Window Control.</i></p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Navigator"></a>Navigator </h2>
                    <p><i>Navigator</i> is a prediction tool that automatically finds the optimal oven setup for each product you profile.  <i>Navigator</i> lets you understand how changes to belt speed and oven set points will affect a product profile by evaluating billions of potential recipes settings, automatically selecting the profile and oven setup that best fits the Process Window.  This automated prediction tool is exponentially more powerful and accurate than any tool currently on the market and allows you to find the optimal profile in about a minute.  The automated prediction tool is designed to center the profile in your process window, and you may set the limits to fit your process.  An example of this is running sensitive components with lead-free solders: if your assembly cannot see temperatures above 235<span class="span_17">°</span>C but must see a fairly high peak temperature to reflow the lead-free solder, <i>Navigator</i> will find a profile that will be centered between the high and low limits.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the most significant feature of the software and the <i>Navigator</i> tool is that they rank your profiles using the <i>Process Window Index</i>.  This allows you to compare performance between processes and, more importantly, to be assured that you have found the most robust and reliable profile for a given product that your oven can achieve.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Auto_Focus"></a>Auto-Focus </h2>
                    <p><i>Auto-Focus</i> is simulation software that eliminates the need to guess at an initial oven recipe.  <i>Auto-Focus</i> automatically calculates the ideal oven recipe, allowing you to avoid conventional oven setup pitfalls.  <i>Auto-Focus</i> gets smarter with every profile you run, providing you with increasingly accurate oven recipes.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Navigator_Auto_Focus"></a>Navigator/Auto&#8209;Focus Power</h2>
                    <p>Used with <i>Navigator</i> and <i>Auto-Focus</i> software, the <i>Power</i> feature optimizes your profiles and/or initial oven settings based on reduced energy use.  Studies have shown that many reflow ovens consume more energy than required in order to process the products in spec.  The <i>Navigator Power and Auto-Focus Power</i> functions identify the oven or wave solder recipes that consume the least amount of energy while processing the products in spec.  The result is improved quality at reduced energy costs.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Sweet_Spot"></a>Sweet Spot</h2>
                    <p>The <i>Sweet Spot</i> feature allows you to define a “non-centered” target value for your statistics when creating a Process Window.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Index_Screen_And_Production_Reports"></a>Index Screen</h2>
                    <p>The <i>Index screen</i> displays a comprehensive summary of production quality-assurance information including items such as DPMO and Yield, as well as an overview of the current production run.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Statistical_Process_Control_Charts"></a>Statistical Process Control Charts</h2>
                    <p><i>Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts</i> provide graphical data of the key process parameters that need to be monitored for product quality assurance.  SPC charts aid the ability to understand the predictability of the process and to know in real-time when a process may be changing and affect product quality.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Troubleshooting_Screen"></a>Troubleshooting Screen</h2>
                    <p>The <i>Troubleshooting</i> screen uses a bar chart to display the temperature changes measured by the probes in each zone as compared to your baseline profile.  The screen can also chart conveyor speed deviation.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="O2_Live"></a>O2 Live </h2>
                    <p><span class="span_12">O2 Live</span> allows you to display in a profile or Virtual Profile data, an O2 PPM measured value collected from the users existing O2 analyzer.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="VP_Idle_Mode"></a>VP Idle Mode</h2>
                    <p><i>VP Idle Mode</i> allows the automatic system software to automatically go into a type of “sleep mode” during Virtual Profiling when the energy saving function of some newer ovens is in use.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Barcode"></a>Barcode</h2>
                    <p>There are two different barcode features available – <i>Traceability</i> and <i>Process Control</i>. See the <i>Barcode</i> section for complete details of each function.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Lot_ID"></a>Lot ID</h2>
                    <p>The <i>Lot ID</i> feature allows you to assign a specific ID to a given VP production run. This ID is then searchable from within Profile Explorer.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Remote_Process_Monitoring"></a>Remote Process Monitoring</h2>
                    <p><i>The Remote Process Monitoring (RPM) system</i> distributes real-time thermal process information for display on monitors anywhere on your network.  When a software system installed at an oven includes RPM, it runs in Virtual Profiling mode, monitoring the process and transmitting real-time data for each production board as an <i>output</i>.  Each output includes the oven name, product name, Process Window Index (PWI), real-time Process Capability Index (Cpk), and the current alarm status, including the text and light bar state.  As each board exists the oven, its data output is sent to a computer provisioned with RPM server software that can both display the data and act as the as distribution hub for a network of viewing terminals.  With the appropriate software installed, these additional networked computers can access the data from the main RPM server and display it on their own monitors.  RPM software can display data as an iconic status overview of the whole production floor, individual oven process histories, or graphs charting the last 100 production units.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Live_Data_Output1"></a>Live Data Output</h2>
                    <p><i>Live Data Output (LDO)</i> processes data for every board as real-time output for use with third-party applications.  Third-party software can provide line balancing, production host monitoring or statistical process control.</p>
                    <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Centrali"></a>Centralized Process Window Control</h2>
                    <p>This optional feature enables a customer to ensure that every instance of the software is always using the same Process Window files and prevents unauthorized editing of specifications.</p>
