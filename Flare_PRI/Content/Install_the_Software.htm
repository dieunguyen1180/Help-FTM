        <h1 class="Heading1"><a name="Introducing_the_RPI_system"></a>Introducing the PRI System</h1>
        <p><span class="span_7">Pyrometer Reflow Inspection (PRI)</span> is the first ever reflow inspection system to utilize pyrometers installed throughout the oven process tunnel.&#160; These pyrometers measure the real-time temperature of production boards directly, without making contact, sensing their infrared energy as they go through the oven.&#160; </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Pyrometer Reflow Inspection system is a comprehensive suite of thermal process management tools designed to give you the ultimate in PCB soldering quality control. KIC PRI can monitor the entire thermal process, giving advanced warning before a product drifts out of specification.&#160; Its barcode control features can prevent costly product/recipe mismatches, and its power management features enable efficient operation at the lowest energy cost.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>PRI combines software and hardware components into an integrated system, supplementing its thermal profile analysis core with special tools for performance optimization, changed variable prediction, and data file management. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Understanding_the1"></a>The Hardware</h2>
        <p>The major hardware components to a PRI system are:</p>
        <ul class="ul_6">
            <li class="li_9">Data Acquisition Unit (DAU)</li>
            <li class="li_9">Pyrometer sensors</li>
            <li class="li_9">Purge Blocks</li>
            <li class="li_9">Conveyor speed encoder</li>
            <li class="li_9">Product sensor</li>
            <li class="li_9">Alarm Relay/Light Tower</li>
            <li class="li_9">Profiler</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3">DAU</h3>
        <p>The DAU is the main control unit for the system, to which all installed sensors connect through. It interfaces with the computer using an Ethernet cross-over cable that connects from the UpLink port on the DAU directly to a USB to Ethernet adapter (or to an installed Network Interface Card (NIC)).&#160; Please follow manufacturers’ instructions to install the USB adapter or NIC.&#160; </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The computer used with the PRI system can be a machine that is dedicated to only supporting PRI or it can also serve as the oven controller PC.&#160; PRI can interface directly with the oven controller on selected models from many oven manufacturers.&#160; When installed on an oven that is capable of communication with the PRI software, it will allow information (zone setpoints, conveyor setpoints, etc.) to be exchanged between the PRI software and the oven controller software. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The DAU must be plugged into an AC power source.&#160; The DAU utilizes a universal A/C transformer power supply.&#160; The DAU ships from the factory with multiple AC connectors to accommodate any connector/voltage requirement.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Pyrometers</h3>
        <p>The pyrometers are installed in the oven process tunnel.&#160; They are mounted on the fixed rail, or in a manner that allows clear visibility of the printed circuit boards without interfering with the product flow by oven manufacturer approved brackets. The pyrometers are connected to an adapter box, which adapts the inputs to the DAU.&#160; Typically half the pyrometers enter from the oven entrance and half enter from the oven exit. Pyrometers 1-6 are connected into one adapter box that will be plugged into the A labeled input of the DAU and pyrometers 7-12 are connected into the other adapter box and plugged into the DAU input labeled B.&#160; </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><span class="normaltextrun">N</span><span class="normaltextrun">itrogen</span><span class="normaltextrun"> or Compressed Air </span><span class="normaltextrun">Purge Block</span>
        </h3>
        <p class="normaltextrun">Dual Purge Blocks supply a regulated flow of gas or air to each of the pyrometer sensors. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Conveyor Speed Encoder</h3>
        <p>The conveyor speed encoder is a sensor mounted to sense the teeth of a gear that turns while the conveyor is moving.&#160; The conveyor speed encoder connects to channel #1 of the DAU Sensor ports.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Product Sensor</h3>
        <p>The product sensor is typically mounted near the entrance of the oven, on the fixed conveyor rail.&#160; The sensor is connected to channel #2 of the DAU Sensor ports.&#160; The first pyrometer acts as the main board sensing device, but the product sensor at the entrance of the oven is used to display the boards as they travel from the oven entrance to the first pyrometer (middle of zone 1).</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Alarm Relay/Light Tower </h3>
        <p>The Alarm Relay connects to the Alarm/Barcode port of the DAU and provides a method for external notification to the user when an alarm condition occurs. It allows for a KIC supplied audible light tower to be powered and triggered; it can include SMEMA interface connections; it also allows a user to hardwire in an external device of their choosing. The Alarm Relay is required to have an external AC power source. </p>
        <p>There are two audible light towers available – one model connects directly to the Alarm Relay device; the other model connects directly to the USB port of the PC. See the <a href="Troubleshooting.htm#Light_Tower">Light Tower section</a>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Profiler </h3>
        <p>The profiler is a separately offered data acquisition component that is required to use the PRI system.&#160; It provides the on-board, through-the-process temperature data, what we call the “Thermocouple Profile”. </p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Profiler Models
        </h4>
        <p>The following profiler models are compatible with the PRI system software:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
            <li class="li_2">SPS Smart Profiler</li>
            <li class="li_5">X<sup>5</sup></li>
            <li class="li_5">K<sup>2</sup></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_36">The SPS profilers are available in two different configurations —datalogger and datalog/wireless<span class="span_6">.</span>&#160; In standard datalogger mode, the profiler records temperature data as it moves through the thermal process.&#160; A download cable is then connected to download the data to the PC running the PRI software.&#160; In wireless mode, the profiler transmits data by Wi-Fi via a Smart Dock connected to the PC.&#160; The PRI software displays the accumulating data in real-time.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For specific information regarding your profiler, consult one of the following KIC publications:</p>

        <h3 class="Heading3">Additional Components</h3>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Barcode Reader</h4>
        <p>A user-supplied barcode reader can connect to the DAU Alarm/Barcode port (when using a DB-9 serial connection), to one of the DAU USB ports (when using a USB barcode scanner), or to a PC Com or USB port.&#160; When used in conjunction with the Alarm Relay, the serial barcode reader hardware can connect to the DAU via the Alarm Relay Y- cable.&#160; The barcode reader is mounted on the entrance side of the oven, on the in-feed conveyor. For additional information about using barcode scanners, see <a href="Appendix_C.htm#Barcode_Tab"><span class="span_6">Appendix C – Barcode Tab.</span></a></p>
