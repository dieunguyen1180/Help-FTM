        <p>The Units Per Hour (UPH) function can display on the General Tab when PP is running, a count of how many boards (Units) have been processed in the last hour. The number automatically resets back to 0 at the top of the hour.</p>

        <h1 class="Heading1"><a name="Auto-VP"></a>Auto-PP</h1>
        <p>Auto-PP is an available feature that allows for an automated changeover process. Typically, during a product changeover, an Operator must manually stop the currently running PP, then go into the oven software and select and load the correct oven recipe for the next product to be processed. Then they must go into the KIC software and select the corresponding product and load that PP. This can sometimes lead to the wrong selection being chosen by the user.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Using barcodes, MES control programs, or oven communication, the Auto- PP feature can eliminate the need for Operator intervention in the product changeover process. The proper oven recipe and corresponding PP is automatically loaded based on information sent to the software.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are multiple configurations of the Auto- PP feature depending on the capabilities and processes in place in the factory. Please contact KIC Tech Support to identify if this functionality can be implemented with your system.</p>
