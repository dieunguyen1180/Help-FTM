                    <p>The Alarm Relay connects to the Alarm/Barcode port of the eTPU, and provides an external notification to the user when an alarm condition occurs. It allows for an optional audible light tower to be powered and triggered; can include SMEMA interface connections; and it allows a user to hardwire in an external device of their choosing. The Alarm Relay is required to have an external AC power source.</p>

                    <p><b>Note:</b> For more information about the hardware components of the system, see the <i>Automatic System Hardware Installation Manual (TFS-330210-000).</i></p>

                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The Light Tower is a means of providing an audio and/or visual cue when the automatic system software has determined that the oven process has reached an out-of-control condition.</p>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                    <p>The light tower can only be used with the <i>optional Alarm Relay</i>, as it plugs directly into the <i>Alarm Relay</i> box. It uses a single Red light with an audible buzzer, which are both activated anytime an alarm condition occurs. Because it is controlled directly by the <i>Alarm Relay</i>, the light and audible buzzer will stay on for as long as the <i>Alarm Relay</i> is energized.</p>
